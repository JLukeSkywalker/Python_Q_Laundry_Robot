# Python_Q_Laundry_Robot
Basic Modular Q-Learning Game for Teaching

Sets up and runs a basic Q-learning game where a robot has to pick up dirty laundry in the room and throw it into the hamper. 
Have students impliment their own Robot class that extends the Robot abstract class to have it run in the game. I would suggest starting with getting the students to give actions in their Robot with input(), see how it works, add the Q-table, update it, and still move manually. They can manually move around and see how the table updates, then add in the explore/exploit. Use the included SampleRobot if needed. Student robots must be named and in files as NAMERobot and the class must extend Robot, just like SampleRobot. Run it by inputting SampleRobot or NAMERobot when asked.
